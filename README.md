# Academic Email Assistant POC

An Outlook add-in that brings a locally-hosted AI agent directly into your email sidebar. Built on the OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket protocol with Ollama for fully local inference — no data leaves your machine.

## Features

- 📧 **Email Context** — Automatically reads subject, sender, recipients, date, and body of the selected email
- 💬 **Chat Interface** — Ask questions about the email, get summaries, translations, or any AI assistance
- ✏️ **Draft Reply** — One-click reply drafting based on the email context
- 📤 **Send Reply** — Opens Outlook's native reply compose with the drafted text pre-filled
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Mode** — Auto-detects Outlook theme (Office.js + prefers-color-scheme)
- 📌 **Pinned Sidebar** — Stays open when switching between emails (VersionOverrides v1.1)
- 💾 **Per-Email Chat History** — Each email gets its own session; switching back restores the conversation
- 📎 **Smart Context** — Email body sent only with the first message per email (saves tokens)
- 🔄 **Auto-Reconnect** — WebSocket reconnects automatically with exponential backoff
- 🔒 **Token-based Auth** — Gateway token stored in browser localStorage, never in code

## Architecture

```
Outlook Add-in (HTTPS :3000)
        │  wss://localhost:3000/ai-gateway
        ▼
Webpack Dev Server proxy
        │  ws://127.0.0.1:18789

OpenClaw Gateway (local)
        │

Ollama (llama3.1:8b — http://127.0.0.1:11434)
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **OpenClaw** — `npm install -g openclaw`
- **Ollama** — [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) with `llama3.1:8b` pulled
- **Outlook Desktop** (Windows, Classic) or Outlook Web (OWA)
- **Microsoft 365** account with sideloading enabled

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Install dev certificates (first time only)

```bash
npx office-addin-dev-certs install
```

### 3. Pull the AI model

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### 4. Configure OpenClaw

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and add the following under `gateway.controlUi`:

```json
"controlUi": {
  "dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth": true
}
```

### 5. Start OpenClaw Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

Note the gateway token from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`.

### 6. Start the dev server

```bash
npm start
```

### 7. Sideload the add-in

In Outlook, go to **Get Add-ins → My Add-ins → Add a custom add-in → Add from file** and select `manifest.xml`.

### 8. Enter your gateway token

Open any email and click **Academic Assistant** in the ribbon. Click the **⚙ settings icon** in the sidebar and paste your token from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`. Click Save — the status bar should turn green (Connected).

> Each OpenClaw installation generates a unique token. The token is saved in browser localStorage so you only need to enter it once.

## Running

With both the gateway and dev server running, open any email in Outlook and click **Academic Assistant** in the ribbon. The add-in opens in a sidebar and automatically reads the selected email.

- Type a question and press Enter or click Send
- Click **Draft Reply** to generate a professional reply
- Click **Use Draft** to open Outlook's reply compose with the draft pre-filled
- Click the 📌 pin icon to keep the sidebar open when switching emails

## Gateway Token

The gateway token is read from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`. It is stored in browser `localStorage` under the key `acad-gateway-token`. To update it, click the ⚙ settings icon in the add-in sidebar.
